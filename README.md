# GameOps
Full-Stack Distributed Gaming Platform
This project is an updated version of my previous work, with new modules and features added. It is currently under testing and being re-uploaded.


## Overview
GameOps is a **real-time distributed gaming platform** that I independently designed and built.  
It focuses on handling **asynchronous messaging**, **scalability**, and **real-time data flow**, making it suitable for large-scale multiplayer applications.  

The project demonstrates **system design skills** such as high concurrency, event-driven architecture, and distributed data processing.

---

## Features
- **Real-time gameplay events** managed via **Kafka event queues** to decouple game logic and user actions.
- **Scalable architecture** supporting 1,000+ concurrent players and 10,000+ messages/minute under stress tests.
- **Low-latency performance** enabled by **Redis caching** with TTL policies for hot session data.
- **Resilient backend** built with **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL** for reliable data storage.
- **Modern frontend** developed with **React + Axios**, delivering a responsive user interface.
- **Containerized deployment** using **Docker**, ensuring portability and production readiness.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: React, Axios, CSS  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker (containerization & stress testing)  

---

## Current Status
ðŸš§ This project is under **active development**.  
The repository will be updated with:
- Full backend implementation
- Frontend UI enhancements
- Deployment scripts & CI/CD pipelines

---

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication & matchmaking
- Enhance monitoring & logging for large-scale usage
- Expand UI for multiple game types
- Deploy to AWS/GCP with auto-scaling
